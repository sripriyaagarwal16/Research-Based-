## 🎯 How to Choose a Research Topic

Choosing the right topic is the foundation of a successful research project.

### ✅ Three Pillars of Topic Selection
1. **Interest** — pick something you genuinely enjoy reading or coding about.  
2. **Feasibility** — ensure data, compute, and your current skills make it doable.  
3. **Impact / Novelty** — solve a real problem or propose a unique improvement.

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Process
1. Start broad (e.g., *medical imaging*, *transformers*, *AI fairness*).  
2. Read 10–20 **survey papers** to understand the landscape.  
3. Identify recurring challenges or gaps.  
4. Shortlist 2–3 micro-topics you can complete within 3–6 months.  
5. Test feasibility by reproducing a baseline experiment.  
6. Frame your **research question** clearly and define evaluation metrics.

## 💡 Finding Novelty & Research Gaps

To bring novelty:
1. Compare 10–15 top papers — note overlapping ideas.  
2. Identify where methods fail or lack real-world validation.  
3. Add new datasets, modify architecture, or propose a new loss function.
